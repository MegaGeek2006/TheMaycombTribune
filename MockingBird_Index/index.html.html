                            <td><p>25 year old Tom Robinson has been arrested for the rape of Mayella Ewell and Atticus Finch fails to defend him. 
                                This court case shook the town and brought in many people from all over Maycomb county just to see the final verdict of black vs white. 
                                The story of the Ewell's goes as follows, every morning Mr. Finch would walk by the Ewell's place on his way to work, 
                                Mayella would invite him in occasionally to work on the house and to help her around the house but one day when she was all alone he upped and raped her, 
                                she was screaming and fighting and her father Robert Ewell heard it, he ran up and saw Tom Robinson "runting on her", 
                                he then scared him off and protected his injured daughter. Tom Robinson's story says he was passing by like everyday and she invited him in to fix a wardrobe, 
                                he noticed there were no children and Mayella said that they went to get ice cream then she upped and kissed him but he tried to resist, 
                                when Robert Ewell showed up he ran away because he was afraid to get killed.
                                The jury found him guilty and he was sent away to prison, while in prison Mr. Robinson attempted to escape and was shot dead to the ground.</p></td>

                    Book Review by Elliott Howden
                </h2>
                <section style="border: solid black; margin:10%; margin-top: 0%;">
                    <p>The novel To Kill a Mockingbird is truly a classic.  I enjoyed reading this book, even though it was for a school assignment.
                        I thought the use of young main characters helped to lighten the frequent discussions of heavy topics like race and justice.
                        The ideas of race and prejudice are very central themes to the book which isn't something we get to talk a lot about today, unlike the 1930's.
                        If I was asked to give a rating, say, out of 5 stars this would be a 4 star book. I loved how the author connected the opening lines to the whole rest of the story with the resolution at the end.
                        I also liked how the book followed two plot lines, Boo Radley and Tom Robinson's trial. They both follow similar ideas like innocence, race,
                        and judging others. One of the best parts of this book is the portrayal of the characters, the innocence of Scout and Jem being raised in an interesting time period with their father,
                        Atticus's morals is something that will stick with me for a long time. The message of this book is something deep and thought provoking, even 60+ years after the book was published.
                        To Kill a Mockingbird is a book I would definitely read again and would recommend as a must read novel to others.

                                A handful of new sports are being introduced this year, including basketball, an American favorite, handball, 
                                and canoeing. From the United States of America, listen in on radio programs for African-American track star Jesse Owens, 
                                who is expected to win many of his main events. And the fan favorite distance runner Louis Zamperini. 
                                Aside from track and field, basketball is being introduced in the Olympic games. American basketball 
                                player Sam Balter is expected to lead the U.S. team to even more medals.  U.S. swimmer Adolph Kiefer 
                                is one of the most powerful swimmers competing and it is anticipated that he will outperform many other athletes. 
                                This year's games are under heavy scrutiny for being held in the newly established Nazi regime in Germany. 
                                Their racist ideologies are already bleeding into the aspects of the games, but the impact of non-white 
                                athletes is already impressing the world, and will continue to throughout the many events. These Olympics 
                                are bigger than just medals for your home country, the impact of these games will be much larger due to the 
                                location, tense political situations, and the appearances of many ethnicities representing their countries.
